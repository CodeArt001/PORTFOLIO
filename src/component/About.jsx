          , a passionate front-end developer with a love for building clean,
          functional, and user-friendly web applications. My journey into web
          development started with curiosity about how websites work, and today,
          I specialize in{" "}
          <strong>HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Reactjs.</strong>

          I enjoy solving problems, turning ideas into interactive experiences,
          and continuously learning to stay aligned with industry standards. My
          approach to development is simple: write clean code, design with
          purpose, and always put the user first.

          Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading, and
          working on personal projects that challenge me to grow. I believe in
          lifelong learning and bringing creativity into everything I do.
